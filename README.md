This repository is a collection of visualization projects I've done for [Viz for Social Good](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/).

# Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT)

The project aims to communicate about the prohibition and prevention of torture in a positive manner through an inspiring visualisation. Despite its absolute prohibition, torture still exists in many countries, for various reasons, through many ways, both in times of war and peace. Often, it targets the most vulnerable and marginalised groups. However, there are reasons to believe that torture has been reduced over time. The project is built on the assumption that, since the adoption of the Convention against Torture by the United Nations in 1984, there has been some progress that can be measured.  APT has identified 8 indicators of measurement. Together, they form a strong legal basis for torture prevention. The APT has collected data to verify the existence of these indicators, covering all countries of the world over a period of 40 years from 1984 to 2024.
